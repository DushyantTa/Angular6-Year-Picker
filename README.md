# Angular6-Year-Picker

Hello, 

I'm new at angular and try to make my own component for only year view. 
Sorry But there is node_modules directory is missing in project because it contains more then 1000 files so I'm not able to upload it right now.

But you can look at on direct "date-picker/src/app/year-picker", Here year-picker is component so you can look at the code directly if you want.and Hope you like it.

please send me a message if anyone finds bug / issue.

Dushyant Tankariya,
Thanks & Regards
